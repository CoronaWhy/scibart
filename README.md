So far, this is a refactoring job of a notebook in [CurationCorp](https://github.com/CurationCorp)'s amazing [curation-corpus repository](https://github.com/CurationCorp/curation-corpus) for training on GPU clusters to tune [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) for abstractive summarization of scientific literature.

Part of the [Coronawhy](http://coronawhy.com) project.
